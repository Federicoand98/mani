## [Unreleased]

First public release. Before tagging, move this section to `## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-14`.

### Added

- **Declarative manifest** with eight blocks, each answering one question:
  `identity`, `capabilities`, `context`, `output`, `policy`, `limits`, `run`,
  `observability`. Unknown keys are rejected instead of ignored.
- **Providers**: Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter, and any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint. A manifest naming a provider that cannot be reached
  fails to start rather than falling back to another model.
- **Built-in tools**: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `delete`, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`,
  `fetch`, `planning`, `delegate`.
- **Custom tools** as subprocesses (JSON on stdin, result on stdout) and through MCP.
- **Governance**: per-tool `allow` / `ask` / `deny`, risk levels including `network`,
  a domain allowlist for network tools with SSRF protection, rules and redaction,
  and per-run ceilings on tokens, tool calls, duration and iterations.
- **Structured output**: declare `output.schema` and the agent returns validated JSON.
- **Unattended execution**: cron and daily triggers driven by an in-process scheduler
  that runs on Linux, macOS and Windows; a durable task queue that survives restarts,
  with retries, backoff and a dead-letter area.
- **Run journal**: every run leaves a readable record on disk, queryable over HTTP.
- **Agent server** over HTTP and WebSocket with bearer authentication, multi-turn
  conversations and a permission back-channel.
- **Interactive terminal chat** with sessions, streaming, and image attachments.
- **CLI**: `run`, `serve`, `init`, `validate`, `tui`, plus `--help` and `--version`,
  with distinct exit codes for usage errors and runtime failures.
- **`!include`** for long system prompts: `prompt: !include ./prompts/reviewer.md`,
  resolved relative to the manifest and checked by `mani validate`.
- **Library use**: import `github.com/Federicoand98/mani` and wire the core with
  your own adapters.
